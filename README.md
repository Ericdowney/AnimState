# AnimState

The purpose of this project is to solve for complex animation code through the use of "Animation State"s.  This will allow a developer to craft different states of their view and then animate between them with ease.  This project is still in its early stages and should not be used for production level code yet.  I have not tested any performance issues, memory leaks, etc.  Currently, there is no support for either Carthage or Cocoapods, but it is in the roadmap.
